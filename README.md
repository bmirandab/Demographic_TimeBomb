# Demographic_TimeBomb

### Metis -- Project Luther

This project attempts to create a model that would predict if countries are at risk of being a "Demographic Time-Bomb", using the Potential Support Ratio (PSR) as its measurement. PSR is a ratio calculated by the working population/population over 60 yrs old. 

The gathering and cleaning can be observed in the luther_dataclean, and the analysis and models can be checked in luther_analyis.
